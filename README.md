# Robust-Principal-Component-Analysis
Robust Principal Component Analysis: Term project of Convex Optimization Course at IIT Kanpur (Spring 2018)

In this term paper, we leveraged RPCA techniques to address video background-foreground seperation and Image inpainting tasks

We compared the performance of the following algorithms:
  1. AltProj
  2. IALM
  3. Robust PCA via Gradient Descent
  4. Non-convex rank approximation based Robust PCA

Datasets we used:
  1. Video foreground-background separation: Escalator video dataset
  2. For image inpainting, we corrupted a given ground truth image with texts
